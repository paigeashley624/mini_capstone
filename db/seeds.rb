# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the bin/rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).

# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)
# product = Product.create(
#   { name: "Nintendo", price: 300, image_url: "https://images.pexels.com/photos/371924/pexels-photo-371924.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&dpr=3&h=750&w=1260", description: "Game system" }
